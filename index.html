	<h1 onclick="alert('Hi Chris')">My Love for Tennis</h1>
  <h2> How It All Started</h2>
	<p>I first began playing the game of tennis at the age of nine. My love for the sport didnâ€™t come until I entered high school, when I began playing more matches and getting a better understanding of the game along with individual coaching of the sport.</p>
  <h3> Perseverance</h3>
<p2>My first tournament was a total disaster in which I lost miserably, but that did not hinder me from continuing the sport I love. To date, I still go out and play semipro tennis for Leagues formed in Maryland and Virginia during the Summer. I also love volunterring for the Citi Open Tournament, which is held at the F1tzgerald Tennis Center located at 16th and Kennedy Streets in Northwest, DC. in mid-August.</p2>
